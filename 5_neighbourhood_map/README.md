# Neighborhood Map - Udacity Front End Nanodegree program
## Athens (Αθήνα) Neighborhood Map

## Introduction
This web application is an interactive map of Athens (Greece) with few locations that I had the pleasure to visit couple of years ago and found tremendously interesting. Therefore I marked them in the map for you to discover this amazing city.

When one of the locations is clicked, a popup window will show up and display additional information about that location:
* Articles related to the location found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org "wikipedia")
* Pictures found 1km around the selected location from [500px](https://500px.com/ "500px")

Also, you can find a collapsible menu showing the list of locations, and a search box which will filter the markers on the map.

## How to run
To run this application download all of the files and open the index.html file. Ensure your internet connection works properly, or the map will not load.
